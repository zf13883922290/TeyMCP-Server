CLI tool to manage Claude MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Easily toggle MCP servers between active and disabled states with an interactive checkbox interface.

Installation

How it works

All server configurations are preserved when toggling between states

Existing ~/.claude.json file with MCP servers configured
