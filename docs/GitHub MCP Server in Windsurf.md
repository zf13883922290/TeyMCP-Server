Install GitHub MCP Server in Windsurf
Prerequisites
Windsurf IDE installed (latest version)
GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes
For local installation: Docker installed and running
Remote Server Setup (Recommended)
The remote GitHub MCP server is hosted by GitHub at https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ and supports Streamable HTTP protocol. Windsurf currently supports PAT authentication only.

Streamable HTTP Configuration
Windsurf supports Streamable HTTP servers with a serverUrl field:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "serverUrl": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_PAT"
      }
    }
  }
}
Local Server Setup
Docker Installation (Required)
Important: The npm package @modelcontextprotocol/server-github is no longer supported as of April 2025. Use the official Docker image ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server instead.

{
  "mcpServers": {

        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
