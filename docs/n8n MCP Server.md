n8n MCP Server
npm version

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants to interact with n8n workflows through natural language.

Overview
This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that empowers AI assistants to seamlessly interact with n8n, a popular workflow automation tool. It acts as a bridge, enabling AI assistants to programmatically manage and control n8n workflows and executions using natural language commands.

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js 20 or later
n8n instance with API access enabled
Install from npm
npm install -g @leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server
Install from source
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server.git
cd n8n-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Optional: Install globally
npm install -g .
Docker Installation
You can also run the server using Docker:

# Pull the image
docker pull leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server

# Run the container with your n8n API configuration
docker run -e N8N_API_URL=http://your-n8n:5678/api/v1 \
  -e N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key \
  -e N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME=username \
  -e N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD=password \
  leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server
Updating the Server
How you update the server depends on how you initially installed it.

1. Installed globally via npm
If you installed the server using npm install -g @leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to get the latest version:
npm install -g @leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server@latest
If the server is currently running (e.g., as a background process or service), you'll need to restart it for the changes to take effect.
2. Installed from source
If you cloned the repository and installed from source:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project:
cd path/to/n8n-mcp-server
If you've made any local changes to the code that you want to keep, consider stashing them (optional):
git stash
You can apply them later with git stash pop.
Pull the latest changes from the repository (assuming you are on the main branch):
git pull origin main
If you are on a different branch, replace main with your branch name.
Install or update any changed dependencies:
npm install
Rebuild the project to include the latest updates:
npm run build
If you previously installed it globally from this source folder using npm install -g ., you might want to run this command again to update the global link:
npm install -g .
Restart the server.
If you run the server directly using a command like node build/index.js in your AI assistant's MCP configuration, ensure the path is still correct. Using npm install -g . and then n8n-mcp-server as the command should keep this consistent.
3. Using Docker
If you are running the server using Docker:

Pull the latest image from Docker Hub:
docker pull leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server:latest
Stop and remove your old container. You'll need your container's name or ID (you can find it using docker ps):
docker stop <your_container_name_or_id>
docker rm <your_container_name_or_id>
Start a new container with the updated image. Use the same docker run command you used previously, including all your necessary environment variables (refer to the "Docker Installation" section for an example command). For instance:
docker run -e N8N_API_URL=http://your-n8n:5678/api/v1 \
  -e N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key \
  -e N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME=username \
  -e N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD=password \
  leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server:latest
Ensure you use :latest or the specific version tag you intend to run.
Configuration
Create a .env file in the directory where you'll run the server, using .env.example as a template:

cp .env.example .env
Configure the following environment variables:

Variable	Description	Example
N8N_API_URL	Full URL of the n8n API, including /api/v1	http://localhost:5678/api/v1
N8N_API_KEY	API key for authenticating with n8n	n8n_api_...
N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME	Username for webhook authentication (if using webhooks)	username
N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD	Password for webhook authentication	password
DEBUG	Enable debug logging (optional)	true or false
Generating an n8n API Key
Open your n8n instance in a browser
Go to Settings > API > API Keys
Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
Copy the key to your .env file
Usage
Running the Server
From the installation directory:

n8n-mcp-server
Or if installed globally:

n8n-mcp-server
Integrating with AI Assistants
After building the server (npm run build), you need to configure your AI assistant (like VS Code with the Claude extension or the Claude Desktop app) to run it. This typically involves editing a JSON configuration file.

Example Configuration (e.g., in VS Code settings.json or Claude Desktop claude_desktop_config.json):

{
  "mcpServers": {
    // Give your server a unique name
    "n8n-local": {
      // Use 'node' to execute the built JavaScript file
      "command": "node",
      // Provide the *absolute path* to the built index.js file
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/cloned/n8n-mcp-server/build/index.js"
        // On Windows, use double backslashes:
        // "C:\\path\\to\\your\\cloned\\n8n-mcp-server\\build\\index.js"
      ],
      // Environment variables needed by the server
      "env": {
        "N8N_API_URL": "http://your-n8n-instance:5678/api/v1", // Replace with your n8n URL
        "N8N_API_KEY": "YOUR_N8N_API_KEY", // Replace with your key
        // Add webhook credentials only if you plan to use webhook tools
        // "N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME": "your_webhook_user",
        // "N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD": "your_webhook_password"
      },
      // Ensure the server is enabled
      "disabled": false,
      // Default autoApprove settings
      "autoApprove": []
    }
    // ... other servers might be configured here
  }
}
Key Points:

Replace /path/to/your/cloned/n8n-mcp-server/ with the actual absolute path where you cloned and built the repository.
Use the correct path separator for your operating system (forward slashes / for macOS/Linux, double backslashes \\ for Windows).
Ensure you provide the correct N8N_API_URL (including /api/v1) and N8N_API_KEY.
The server needs to be built (npm run build) before the assistant can run the build/index.js file.
Available Tools
The server provides the following tools:

Using Webhooks
This MCP server supports executing workflows through n8n webhooks. To use this functionality:

Create a webhook-triggered workflow in n8n.
Set up Basic Authentication on your webhook node.
Use the run_webhook tool to trigger the workflow, passing just the workflow name.
Example:

const result = await useRunWebhook({
  workflowName: "hello-world", // Will call <n8n-url>/webhook/hello-world
  data: {
    prompt: "Hello from AI assistant!"
  }
});
The webhook authentication is handled automatically using the N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME and N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD environment variables.
