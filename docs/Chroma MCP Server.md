Chroma MCP Server
smithery badge

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed for effortless integration between LLM applications and external data sources or tools, offering a standardized framework to seamlessly provide LLMs with the context they require.

This server provides data retrieval capabilities powered by Chroma, enabling AI models to create collections over generated data and user inputs, and retrieve that data using vector search, full text search, metadata filtering, and more.

This is a MCP server for self-hosting your access to Chroma. If you are looking for Package Search you can find the repository for that here.

Embedding Functions
Chroma MCP supports several embedding functions: default, cohere, openai, jina, voyageai, and roboflow.

The embedding functions utilize Chroma's collection configuration, which persists the selected embedding function of a collection for retrieval. Once a collection is created using the collection configuration, on retrieval for future queries and inserts, the same embedding function will be used, without needing to specify the embedding function again. Embedding function persistance was added in v1.0.0 of Chroma, so if you created a collection using version <=0.6.3, this feature is not supported.

When accessing embedding functions that utilize external APIs, please be sure to add the environment variable for the API key with the correct format, found in Embedding Function Environment Variables

Usage with Claude Desktop
To add an ephemeral client, add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json file:
"chroma": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
        "chroma-mcp"
    ]
}
To add a persistent client, add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json file:
"chroma": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
        "chroma-mcp",
        "--client-type",
        "persistent",
        "--data-dir",
        "/full/path/to/your/data/directory"
    ]
}
This will create a persistent client that will use the data directory specified.

To connect to Chroma Cloud, add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json file:
"chroma": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
        "chroma-mcp",
        "--client-type",
        "cloud",
        "--tenant",
        "your-tenant-id",
        "--database",
        "your-database-name",
        "--api-key",
        "your-api-key"
    ]
}
This will create a cloud client that automatically connects to api.trychroma.com using SSL.

Note: Adding API keys in arguments is fine on local devices, but for safety, you can also specify a custom path for your environment configuration file using the --dotenv-path argument within the args list, for example: "args": ["chroma-mcp", "--dotenv-path", "/custom/path/.env"].

To connect to a [self-hosted Chroma instance on your own cloud provider](https://docs.trychroma.com/ production/deployment), add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json file:
"chroma": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "chroma-mcp", 
      "--client-type", 
      "http", 
      "--host", 
      "your-host", 
      "--port", 
      "your-port", 
      "--custom-auth-credentials",
      "your-custom-auth-credentials",
      "--ssl",
      "true"
    ]
}
This will create an HTTP client that connects to your self-hosted Chroma instance.

Using Environment Variables
You can also use environment variables to configure the client. The server will automatically load variables from a .env file located at the path specified by --dotenv-path (defaults to .chroma_env in the working directory) or from system environment variables. Command-line arguments take precedence over environment variables.

# Common variables
export CHROMA_CLIENT_TYPE="http"  # or "cloud", "persistent", "ephemeral"

# For persistent client
export CHROMA_DATA_DIR="/full/path/to/your/data/directory"

# For cloud client (Chroma Cloud)
export CHROMA_TENANT="your-tenant-id"
export CHROMA_DATABASE="your-database-name"
export CHROMA_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# For HTTP client (self-hosted)
export CHROMA_HOST="your-host"
export CHROMA_PORT="your-port"
export CHROMA_CUSTOM_AUTH_CREDENTIALS="your-custom-auth-credentials"
export CHROMA_SSL="true"

# Optional: Specify path to .env file (defaults to .chroma_env)
export CHROMA_DOTENV_PATH="/path/to/your/.env" 
Embedding Function Environment Variables
When using external embedding functions that access an API key, follow the naming convention CHROMA_<>_API_KEY="<key>". So to set a Cohere API key, set the environment variable CHROMA_COHERE_API_KEY="". We recommend adding this to a .env file somewhere and using the CHROMA_DOTENV_PATH environment variable or --dotenv-path flag to set that location for safekeeping.
