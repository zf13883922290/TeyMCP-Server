Policies & Governance for the GitHub MCP Server
Organizations and enterprises have several existing control mechanisms for the GitHub MCP server on GitHub.com:

MCP servers in Copilot Policy
Copilot Editor Preview Policy (temporary)
OAuth App Access Policies
GitHub App Installation
Personal Access Token (PAT) policies
SSO Enforcement
This document outlines how these policies apply to different deployment modes, authentication methods, and host applications – while providing guidance for managing GitHub MCP Server access across your organization.

How the GitHub MCP Server Works
The GitHub MCP Server provides access to GitHub resources and capabilities through a standardized protocol, with flexible deployment and authentication options tailored to different use cases. It supports two deployment modes, both built on the same underlying codebase.

1. Local GitHub MCP Server
Runs: Locally alongside your IDE or application
Authentication & Controls: Requires Personal Access Tokens (PATs). Users must generate and configure a PAT to connect. Managed via PAT policies.
Can optionally use GitHub App installation tokens when embedded in a GitHub App-based tool (rare).
Supported SKUs: Can be used with GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) and GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC).

2. Remote GitHub MCP Server
Runs: As a hosted service accessed over the internet
Authentication & Controls: (determined by the chosen authentication method)
GitHub App Installation Tokens: Uses a signed JWT to request installation access tokens (similar to the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow) to operate as the application itself. Provides granular control via installation, permissions and repository access controls.
OAuth Authorization Code Flow: Uses the standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow. Controlled via OAuth App access policies for OAuth apps. For GitHub Apps that sign in (are authorized by) a user, control access to your organization via installation.
Personal Access Tokens (PATs): Managed via PAT policies.
SSO enforcement: Applies when using OAuth Apps, GitHub Apps, and PATs to access resources in organizations and enterprises with SSO enabled. Acts as an overlay control. Users must have a valid SSO session for your organization or enterprise when signing into the app or creating the token in order for the token to access your resources. Learn more in the SSO documentation.
Supported Platforms: Currently available only on GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC). Remote hosting for GHES is not supported at this time.

Note: This does not apply to the Local GitHub MCP Server, which uses PATs and does not rely on GitHub App installations.

Enterprise Install Considerations
When using the Remote GitHub MCP Server, if authenticating with OAuth instead of PAT, each host application must have a registered GitHub App (or OAuth App) to authenticate on behalf of the user.
Enterprises may choose to install these apps in multiple organizations (e.g., per team or department) to scope access narrowly, or at the enterprise level to centralize access control across all child organizations.
Enterprise installation is only supported for GitHub Apps. OAuth Apps can only be installed on a per organization basis in multi-org enterprises.
Security Principles for Both Modes
Authentication: Required for all operations, no anonymous access
Authorization: Access enforced by GitHub's native permission model. Users and apps cannot use an MCP server to access more resources than they could otherwise access normally via the API.
Communication: All data transmitted over HTTPS with optional SSE for real-time updates
Rate Limiting: Subject to GitHub API rate limits based on authentication method
Token Storage: Tokens should be stored securely using platform-appropriate credential storage
Audit Trail: All underlying API calls are logged in GitHub's audit log when available
For integration architecture and implementation details, see the Host Integration Guide.

Where It's Used
The GitHub MCP server can be accessed in various environments (referred to as "host" applications):

First-party Hosts: GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode with integrated MCP support, as well as Copilot Coding Agent.
Third-party Hosts: Editors outside the GitHub ecosystem, such as Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline, that support connecting to MCP servers, as well as AI chat applications like Claude Desktop and other AI assistants that connect to MCP servers to fetch GitHub context or execute write actions.
What It Can Access
The MCP server accesses GitHub resources based on the permissions granted through the chosen authentication method (PAT, OAuth, or GitHub App). These may include:

Repository contents (files, branches, commits)
Issues and pull requests
Organization and team metadata
User profile information
Actions workflow runs, logs, and statuses
Security and vulnerability alerts (if explicitly granted)
Access is always constrained by GitHub's public API permission model and the authenticated user's privileges.

Control Mechanisms
1. Copilot Editors (first-party) → MCP Servers in Copilot Policy
Policy: MCP servers in Copilot
Location: Enterprise/Org → Policies → Copilot
What it controls: When disabled, completely blocks all GitHub MCP Server access (both remote and local) for affected Copilot editors. Currently applies to VS Code and Copilot Coding Agent, with more Copilot editors expected to migrate to this policy over time.
Impact when disabled: Host applications governed by this policy cannot connect to the GitHub MCP Server through any authentication method (OAuth, PAT, or GitHub App).
What it does NOT affect:
MCP support in Copilot on IDEs that are still in public preview (Visual Studio, JetBrains, Xcode, Eclipse)
Third-party IDE or host apps (like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) not governed by GitHub's Copilot policies
Community-authored MCP servers using GitHub's public APIs
Important: This policy provides comprehensive control over GitHub MCP Server access in Copilot editors. When disabled, users in affected applications will not be able to use the GitHub MCP Server regardless of deployment mode (remote or local) or authentication method.

Temporary: Copilot Editor Preview Policy
Policy: Editor Preview Features
Status: Being phased out as editors migrate to the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy above, and once the Remote GitHub MCP server goes GA
What it controls: When disabled, prevents remaining Copilot editors from using the Remote GitHub MCP Server through OAuth connections in all first-party and third-party host applications (does not affect local deployments or PAT authentication)
Note: As Copilot editors migrate from the "Copilot Editor Preview" policy to the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy, the scope of control becomes more centralized, blocking both remote and local GitHub MCP Server access when disabled. Access in third-party hosts is governed separately by OAuth App, GitHub App, and PAT policies.

2. Third-Party Host Apps (e.g., Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) → OAuth App or GitHub App Controls
a. OAuth App Access Policies
Control Mechanism: OAuth App access restrictions
Location: Org → Settings → Third-party Access → OAuth app policy
How it works:
Organization admins must approve OAuth App requests before host apps can access organization data
Only applies when the host registers an OAuth App AND the user connects via OAuth 2.0 flow
b. GitHub App Installation
Control Mechanism: GitHub App installation and permissions
Location: Org → Settings → Third-party Access → GitHub Apps
What it controls: Organization admins must install the app, select repositories, and grant permissions before the app can access organization-owned data or resources through the Remote GitHub Server.
How it works:
Organization admins must install the app, specify repositories, and approve permissions
Only applies when the host registers a GitHub App AND the user authenticates through that flow
Note: The authentication methods available depend on what your host application supports. While PATs work with any remote MCP-compatible host, OAuth and GitHub App authentication are only available if the host has registered an app with GitHub. Check your host application's documentation or support for more info.

3. PAT Access from Any Host → PAT Restrictions
Types: Fine-grained PATs (recommended) and Classic tokens (legacy)
Location:
User level: Personal Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
Enterprise/Organization level: Enterprise/Organization → Settings → Personal Access Tokens (to control PAT creation/access policies)
What it controls: Applies to all host apps and both local & remote GitHub MCP servers when users authenticate via PAT.
How it works: Access limited to the repositories and scopes selected on the token.
Limitations: PATs do not adhere to OAuth App policies and GitHub App installation controls. They are user-scoped and not recommended for production automation.
Organization controls:
Classic PATs: Can be completely disabled organization-wide
Fine-grained PATs: Cannot be disabled but require explicit approval for organization access
Recommendation: We recommend using fine-grained PATs over classic tokens. Classic tokens have broader scopes and can be disabled in organization settings.

4. SSO Enforcement (overlay control)
Location: Enterprise/Organization → SSO settings
What it controls: OAuth tokens and PATs must map to a recent SSO login to access SSO-protected organization data.
How it works: Applies to ALL host apps when using OAuth or PATs.
Exception: Does NOT apply to GitHub App installation tokens (these are installation-scoped, not user-scoped)

Current Limitations
While the GitHub MCP Server provides dynamic tooling and capabilities, the following enterprise governance features are not yet available:

Single Enterprise/Organization-Level Toggle
GitHub does not provide a single toggle that blocks all GitHub MCP server traffic for every user. Admins can achieve equivalent coverage by combining the controls shown here:

First-party Copilot Editors (GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Eclipse):
Disable the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy for comprehensive control
Or disable the Editor Preview Features policy (for editors still using the legacy policy)
Third-party Host Applications:
Configure OAuth app restrictions
Manage GitHub App installations
PAT Access in All Host Applications:
Implement fine-grained PAT policies (applies to both remote and local deployments)
MCP-Specific Audit Logging
At present, MCP traffic appears in standard GitHub audit logs as normal API calls. Purpose-built logging for MCP is on the roadmap, but the following views are not yet available:

Real-time list of active MCP connections
Dashboards showing granular MCP usage data, like tools or host apps
Granular, action-by-action audit logs
Until those arrive, teams can continue to monitor MCP activity through existing API log entries and OAuth/GitHub App events.
