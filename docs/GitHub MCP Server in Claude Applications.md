Install GitHub MCP Server in Claude Applications
Claude Code CLI
Prerequisites
Claude Code CLI installed
GitHub Personal Access Token
For local setup: Docker installed and running
Open Claude Code inside the directory for your project (recommended for best experience and clear scope of configuration)
Storing Your PAT Securely
Remote Server Setup (Streamable HTTP)
Run the following command in the Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_PAT"
With an environment variable:

claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer $(grep GITHUB_PAT .env | cut -d '=' -f2)"
Restart Claude Code
Run claude mcp list to see if the GitHub server is configured
Local Server Setup (Docker required)
With Docker
Run the following command in the Claude Code CLI:
claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_PAT -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
With an environment variable:

claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(grep GITHUB_PAT .env | cut -d '=' -f2) -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
Restart Claude Code
Run claude mcp list to see if the GitHub server is configured
With a Binary (no Docker)
Download release binary
Add to your PATH
Run:
claude mcp add-json github '{"command": "github-mcp-server", "args": ["stdio"], "env": {"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_GITHUB_PAT"}}'
Restart Claude Code
Run claude mcp list to see if the GitHub server is configured
Verification
claude mcp list
claude mcp get github
Claude Desktop
⚠️ Note: Some users have reported compatibility issues with Claude Desktop and Docker-based MCP servers. We're investigating. If you experience issues, try using another MCP host, while we look into it!

Prerequisites
Claude Desktop installed (latest version)
GitHub Personal Access Token
Docker installed and running
Note: Claude Desktop supports MCP servers that are both local (stdio) and remote ("connectors"). Remote servers can generally be added via Settings → Connectors → "Add custom connector". However, the GitHub remote MCP server requires OAuth authentication through a registered GitHub App (or OAuth App), which is not currently supported. Use the local Docker setup instead.

Configuration File Location
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
Linux: ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
Local Server Setup (Docker)
Add this codeblock to your claude_desktop_config.json:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_GITHUB_PAT"
      }
    }
  }
}
Manual Setup Steps
Open Claude Desktop
Go to Settings → Developer → Edit Config
Paste the code block above in your configuration file
If you're navigating to the configuration file outside of the app:
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
Open the file in a text editor
Paste one of the code blocks above, based on your chosen configuration (remote or local)
Replace YOUR_GITHUB_PAT with your actual token or $GITHUB_PAT environment variable
Save the file
Restart Claude Desktop
Troubleshooting
Authentication Failed:

Verify PAT has repo scope
Check token hasn't expired
Remote Server:

Verify URL: https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp
Docker Issues (Local Only):

Ensure Docker Desktop is running
Try: docker pull ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
If pull fails: docker logout ghcr.io then retry
Server Not Starting / Tools Not Showing:

Run claude mcp list to view currently configured MCP servers
Validate JSON syntax
If using an environment variable to store your PAT, make sure you're properly sourcing your PAT using the environment variable
Restart Claude Code and check /mcp command
Delete the GitHub server by running claude mcp remove github and repeating the setup process with a different method
Make sure you're running Claude Code within the project you're currently working on to ensure the MCP configuration is properly scoped to your project
Check logs:
Claude Code: Use /mcp command
Claude Desktop: ls ~/Library/Logs/Claude/ and cat ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-*.log (macOS) or %APPDATA%\Claude\logs\ (Windows)
Important Notes
The npm package @modelcontextprotocol/server-github is deprecated as of April 2025
Remote server requires Streamable HTTP support (check your Claude version)
Configuration scopes for Claude Code:
-s user: Available across all projects
-s project: Shared via .mcp.json file
