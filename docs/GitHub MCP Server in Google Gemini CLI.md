Install GitHub MCP Server in Google Gemini CLI
Prerequisites
Google Gemini CLI installed (see official Gemini CLI documentation)
GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes
For local installation: Docker installed and running
Storing Your PAT Securely
GitHub MCP Server Configuration
MCP servers for Gemini CLI are configured in its settings JSON under an mcpServers key.

Global configuration: ~/.gemini/settings.json where ~ is your home directory
Project-specific: .gemini/settings.json in your project directory
After securely storing your PAT, you can add the GitHub MCP server configuration to your settings file using one of the methods below. You may need to restart the Gemini CLI for changes to take effect.

Note: For the most up-to-date configuration options, see the main README.md.

Method 1: Gemini Extension (Recommended)
The simplest way is to use GitHub's hosted MCP server via our gemini extension.

gemini extensions install https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server

Note

You will still need to have a personal access token with the appropriate scopes called GITHUB_MCP_PAT in your environment.

Method 2: Remote Server
You can also connect to the hosted MCP server directly. After securely storing your PAT, configure Gemini CLI with:

// ~/.gemini/settings.json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
            "httpUrl": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer $GITHUB_MCP_PAT"
            }
        }
    }
}
Method 3: Local Docker
With docker running, you can run the GitHub MCP server in a container:

// ~/.gemini/settings.json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
            "command": "docker",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "-i",
                "--rm",
                "-e",
                "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
                "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
            ],
            "env": {
                "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_MCP_PAT"
            }
        }
    }
}
Method 4: Binary
You can download the latest binary release from the GitHub releases page or build it from source by running go build -o github-mcp-server ./cmd/github-mcp-server.

Then, replacing /path/to/binary with the actual path to your binary, configure Gemini CLI with:

// ~/.gemini/settings.json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
            "command": "/path/to/binary",
            "args": ["stdio"],
            "env": {
                "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_MCP_PAT"
            }
        }
    }
}
Verification
To verify that the GitHub MCP server has been configured, start Gemini CLI in your terminal with gemini, then:

Check MCP server status:

/mcp list
ℹConfigured MCP servers:

🟢 github - Ready (96 tools, 2 prompts)
    Tools:
    - github__add_comment_to_pending_review
    - github__add_issue_comment
    - github__add_sub_issue
    ...
Test with a prompt

List my GitHub repositories
Additional Configuration
You can find more MCP configuration options for Gemini CLI here: MCP Configuration Structure. For example, bypassing tool confirmations or excluding specific tools.

Troubleshooting
Local Server Issues
Docker errors: Ensure Docker Desktop is running
docker --version
Image pull failures: Try docker logout ghcr.io then retry
Docker not found: Install Docker Desktop and ensure it's running
Authentication Issues
Invalid PAT: Verify your GitHub PAT has correct scopes:
repo - Repository operations
read:packages - Docker image access (if using Docker)
Token expired: Generate a new GitHub PAT
Configuration Issues
Invalid JSON: Validate your configuration:
cat ~/.gemini/settings.json | jq .
MCP connection issues: Check logs for connection errors:
gemini --debug "test command"
