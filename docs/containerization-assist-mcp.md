VS Code Setup
Add the following to your VS Code settings or create .vscode/mcp.json in your project:

{
  "servers": {
    "containerization-assist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "containerization-assist-mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "DOCKER_SOCKET": "/var/run/docker.sock",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
Restart VS Code to enable the MCP server in GitHub Copilot.

Windows Users
For Windows, use the Windows Docker pipe:

"DOCKER_SOCKET": "//./pipe/docker_engine"
Quick Start
The easiest way to understand the containerization workflow is through an end-to-end example:

Single-App Containerization Journey
This MCP server guides you through a complete containerization workflow for a single application. The journey follows this sequence:

Analyze Repository → Understand your application's language, framework, and dependencies
Generate Dockerfile → Create an optimized, security-hardened container configuration
Build Image → Compile your application into a Docker image
Scan Image → Identify security vulnerabilities and get remediation guidance
Tag Image → Apply appropriate version tags to your image
Generate K8s Manifests → Create deployment configurations for Kubernetes
Prepare Cluster → Set up namespace and prerequisites (if needed)
Deploy → Deploy your application to Kubernetes
Verify → Confirm deployment health and readiness
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Docker: Running Docker daemon with accessible socket (docker ps should work)
Linux/Mac: /var/run/docker.sock accessible
Windows: Docker Desktop with //./pipe/docker_engine accessible
Kubernetes (optional, for deployment features):
Valid kubeconfig at ~/.kube/config
Cluster connectivity (kubectl cluster-info should work)
Appropriate RBAC permissions for deployments, services, namespaces
Node.js: Version 20 or higher
MCP Client: VS Code with Copilot, Claude Desktop, or another MCP-compatible client
Example Workflow with Natural Language
Once configured in your MCP client (VS Code Copilot, Claude Desktop, etc.), use natural language:

Starting the Journey:

"Analyze my Java application for containerization"
Building the Container:

"Generate an optimized Dockerfile with security best practices"
"Build a Docker image tagged myapp:v1.0.0"
"Scan the image for vulnerabilities"
Deploying to Kubernetes:

"Generate Kubernetes manifests for this application"
"Prepare my cluster and deploy to the default namespace"
"Verify the deployment is healthy"
Single-Operator Model
This server is optimized for one engineer containerizing one application at a time. Key characteristics:

Sequential execution: Each tool builds on the results of previous steps
Fast-fail validation: Clear, actionable error messages if Docker/Kubernetes are unavailable
Deterministic AI generation: Tools provide reproducible outputs through built-in prompt engineering
Real-time progress: MCP notifications surface progress updates to clients during long-running operations
Multi-Module/Monorepo Support
The server detects and supports monorepo structures with multiple independently deployable services:

Automatic Detection: analyze-repo identifies monorepo patterns (npm workspaces, services/, apps/ directories)
Automated Multi-Module Generation: generate-dockerfile and generate-k8s-manifests support multi-module workflows
Conservative Safeguards: Excludes shared libraries and utility folders from containerization
Multi-Module Workflow Example:

1. "Analyze my monorepo at ./my-monorepo"
   → Detects 3 modules: api-gateway, user-service, notification-service

2. "Generate Dockerfiles"
   → Automatically creates Dockerfiles for all 3 modules:
     - services/api-gateway/Dockerfile
     - services/user-service/Dockerfile
     - services/notification-service/Dockerfile

3. "Generate K8s manifests"
   → Automatically creates manifests for all 3 modules

4. Optional: "Generate Dockerfile for user-service module"
   → Creates module-specific deployment manifests
Detection Criteria:

Workspace configurations (npm, yarn, pnpm workspaces, lerna, nx, turborepo, cargo workspace)
Separate package.json, pom.xml, go.mod, Cargo.toml per service
Independent entry points and build configs
EXCLUDES: shared/, common/, lib/, packages/utils directories

The logging directory is validated at startup to ensure it's writable.

Policy System
The policy system enables enforcement of security, quality, and compliance rules through YAML-based policies. Policies use a rule-based system with regex and function matchers to validate Dockerfiles and container configurations.

Default Behavior (No Configuration Needed): By default, all policies in the policies/ directory are automatically discovered and merged:

policies/base-images.yaml - Base image governance (Microsoft Azure Linux recommendation, no :latest tag, deprecated versions, size optimization)
policies/container-best-practices.yaml - Docker best practices (HEALTHCHECK, multi-stage builds, layer optimization)
policies/security-baseline.yaml - Essential security rules (root user prevention, registry restrictions, vulnerability scanning)
This provides comprehensive coverage out-of-the-box.

Policy File Format:

version: '2.0'
metadata:
  name: Production Security Policy
  description: Security and quality rules for production
  category: security

defaults:
  enforcement: strict  # Options: strict, advisory, lenient
  security:
    nonRootUser: true
    scanners:
      required: true
      tools: ['trivy']
  registries:
    allowed:
      - docker.io
      - gcr.io
      - mcr.microsoft.com
    blocked:
      - '*localhost*'

rules:
  - id: block-latest-tag
    category: quality
    priority: 80
    description: Prevent :latest for reproducibility
    conditions:
      - kind: regex
        pattern: 'FROM\s+[^:]+:latest'
        flags: im
    actions:
      block: true
      message: 'Using :latest tag is not allowed. Specify explicit version tags.'

  - id: block-root-user
    category: security
    priority: 95
    description: Enforce non-root user
    conditions:
      - kind: regex
        pattern: '^USER\s+(root|0)\s*$'
        flags: m
    actions:
      block: true
      message: 'Running as root user is not allowed.'
Rule Components:

Conditions:

kind: regex - Match patterns in Dockerfile content
pattern: Regular expression to match
flags: Regex flags (i=case-insensitive, m=multiline)
count_threshold: Minimum matches required (optional)
kind: function - Built-in function matchers
hasPattern - Check if pattern exists in content
fileExists - Check if file exists in context
largerThan - Check if content/file exceeds size threshold
hasVulnerabilities - Check vulnerability scan results
Actions:

block: true - Prevents build/deployment, operation fails
warn: true - Logs warning, operation continues
suggest: true - Provides recommendation, informational only
message: User-facing explanation of the rule violation
Priority Levels:

90-100: Security rules (highest priority)
70-89: Quality rules
50-69: Performance rules
30-49: Compliance rules
Enforcement Modes:

strict: All rules enforced, violations block operations
advisory: Rules evaluated, violations logged but not blocking
lenient: Minimal enforcement, warnings only
Example Policies:

The repository includes three production-ready policies:

policies/base-images.yaml - Base image governance (Microsoft Azure Linux recommendation, no :latest tag, deprecated versions)
policies/security-baseline.yaml - Essential security rules (root user prevention, secrets detection, privileged containers)
policies/container-best-practices.yaml - Docker best practices (HEALTHCHECK, multi-stage builds, layer optimization)
For detailed examples and guidance, see Policy Configuration Guide.

Using Policies:

# Validate Dockerfile with built-in validation + organizational policies
npx containerization-assist fix-dockerfile --path ./Dockerfile

# Use specific policy file for organizational validation
npx containerization-assist fix-dockerfile \
  --path ./Dockerfile \
  --policy-path ./policies/production.yaml

# The fix-dockerfile tool will automatically detect and load policies from the policies/ directory
# It combines:
# - Built-in best practices validation (security, performance, compliance)
# - Custom organizational policy validation (if policies are provided)
Creating Custom Policies:

See existing policies in policies/ for examples.

Policy Discovery and Merging:

The server automatically discovers and loads all .yaml files in the policies/ directory:

Automatic Discovery: All policies in policies/ are loaded and merged automatically
Rule Merging: Rules with the same ID are overridden by later policies (alphabetically sorted)
Default Merging: Later policies override earlier policies' default settings
Priority Sorting: All rules are sorted by priority (highest first) after merging
This allows you to organize policies by concern (security, quality, performance) in separate files while maintaining a unified policy enforcement system.

npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector containerization-assist-mcp start

# Check logs with debug level
npx -y containerization-assist-mcp start --log-level debug
Kubernetes Connection Issues
The server performs fast-fail validation when Kubernetes tools are used. If you encounter Kubernetes errors:

Kubeconfig Not Found

# Check if kubeconfig exists
ls -la ~/.kube/config

# Verify kubectl can connect
kubectl cluster-info

# If using cloud providers, update kubeconfig:
# AWS EKS
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <region>

# Google GKE
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone>

# Azure AKS
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <rg> --name <cluster-name>
Connection Timeout or Refused

# Verify cluster is running
kubectl get nodes

# Check API server address
kubectl config view

# Test connectivity to API server
kubectl cluster-info dump

# Verify firewall rules allow connection to API server port (typically 6443)
Authentication or Authorization Errors

# Check current context and user
kubectl config current-context
kubectl config view --minify

# Test permissions
kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace default
kubectl auth can-i create services --namespace default

# If using cloud providers, refresh credentials:
# AWS EKS: re-run update-kubeconfig
# GKE: run gcloud auth login
# AKS: run az login
Invalid or Missing Context

# List available contexts
kubectl config get-contexts

# Set a context
kubectl config use-context <context-name>

# View current configuration
kubectl config view
