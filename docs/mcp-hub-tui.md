MCP Hub - Claude MCP Configuration Manager
Transform MCP Management from Frustration to Flow

A powerful Terminal User Interface (TUI) for managing Claude Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations. Built for developers who want to streamline their Claude Code workflow without context overload.

🎯 What is MCP Hub?
The Problem: Managing Claude MCPs is painful. You forget commands, lose track of configurations, and get overwhelmed by too many active MCPs cluttering your Claude Code context.

The Solution: MCP Hub provides an intuitive terminal interface that transforms MCP management from a chore into a seamless workflow. Think of it as your personal MCP inventory manager - discover, organize, and activate MCPs with surgical precision.
