VSCode Language Server - Protocol Module
NPM Version NPM Downloads Build Status

This npm module is a tool independent implementation of the language server protocol and can be used in any type of node application. Please note that the protocol is versioned using the LSP specification version number. Since the protocol depends on the vscode-jsonrpc version a a breaking change on that dependencies might not be reflected in a major version change of this module. Changing the major version number in these cases was more confusing this it would result in a version mismatch between the protocol and the LSP specification.

See here for a detailed documentation on the language server protocol.
