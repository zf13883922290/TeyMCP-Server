Ollama MCP Server
This is a rebooted and actively maintained fork.
Original project: NightTrek/Ollama-mcp

This repository (hyzhak/ollama-mcp-server) is a fresh upstream with improved maintenance, metadata, and publishing automation.

See NightTrek/Ollama-mcp for project history and prior releases.

      "env": {
        "OLLAMA_HOST": "http://127.0.0.1:11434"  // Optional: customize Ollama API endpoint
      }

🛠 Developer Setup
Prerequisites
Ollama installed on your system
Node.js and npm
Installation
Install dependencies:
npm install
Build the server:
npm run build
🛠 Usage Examples
Pull and Run a Model
// Pull a model
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "pull",
  arguments: {
    name: "llama2"
  }
});

// Run the model
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "run",
  arguments: {
    name: "llama2",
    prompt: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
  }
});
Run a Vision/Multimodal Model
// Run a model with an image (for vision/multimodal models)
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "run",
  arguments: {
    name: "gemma3:4b",
    prompt: "Describe the contents of this image.",
    imagePath: "./path/to/image.jpg"
  }
});
Chat Completion (OpenAI-compatible)
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "chat_completion",
  arguments: {
    model: "llama2",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ],
    temperature: 0.7
  }
});

// Chat with images (for vision/multimodal models)
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "chat_completion",
  arguments: {
    model: "gemma3:4b",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Describe the contents of this image.",
        images: ["./path/to/image.jpg"]
      }
    ]
  }
});
Note: The images field is optional and only supported by vision/multimodal models.

Create Custom Model
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "create",
  arguments: {
    name: "custom-model",
    modelfile: "./path/to/Modelfile"
  }
});
🧠 Advanced Reasoning with the think Parameter
Both the run and chat_completion tools now support an optional think parameter:

think: true: Requests the model to provide step-by-step reasoning or "thought process" in addition to the final answer (if supported by the model).
think: false (default): Only the final answer is returned.
Example (run tool):
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "run",
  arguments: {
    name: "deepseek-r1:32b",
    prompt: "how many r's are in strawberry?",
    think: true
  }
});
If the model supports it, the response will include a <think>...</think> block with detailed reasoning before the final answer.
Example (chat_completion tool):
await mcp.use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "ollama",
  tool_name: "chat_completion",
  arguments: {
    model: "deepseek-r1:32b",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "how many r's are in strawberry?" }
    ],
    think: true
  }
});
The model's reasoning (if provided) will be included in the message content.
Note: Not all models support the think parameter. Advanced models (e.g., "deepseek-r1:32b", "magistral") may provide more detailed and accurate reasoning when think is enabled.

🔧 Advanced Configuration
OLLAMA_HOST: Configure custom Ollama API endpoint (default: http://127.0.0.1:11434)
Timeout settings for model execution (default: 60 seconds)
Temperature control for response randomness (0-2 range)
