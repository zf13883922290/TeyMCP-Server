About
The MSAL library for JavaScript enables client-side JavaScript applications to authenticate users using Azure AD work and school accounts (AAD), Microsoft personal accounts (MSA) and social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft accounts, etc. through Azure AD B2C service. It also enables your app to get tokens to access Microsoft Cloud services such as Microsoft Graph.

The @azure/msal-common package described by the code in this folder serves as a common package dependency for the @azure/msal-browser package (and in the future, the msal-node package). Be aware that this is an internal library, and is subject to frequent change. It is not meant for production consumption by itself.
